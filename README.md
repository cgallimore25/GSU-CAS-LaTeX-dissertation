## Structure

### Class file

The `gsudiss.cls` class file is made up of various macros and packages to make the outline and formatting of your dissertation easier. 
It is by no means applicable to the entire Georgia State System. 
Those of you who want to use LaTeX to prepare your dissertation, and who are not from CAS, however, can use this style file as a guide to make their own. 
This file is developed to allow a wide range of formatting options, but users should bear in mind that the dissertation guide allows limited formatting beyond the supplied templates. 

NOTE: This style file does not guarantee the satisfaction of all requirements specified by GSU CAS in perpetuity. 
Styles change on a yearly basis and it is up to you (the writer or author) to follow all requirements specified by your specific college or department.
