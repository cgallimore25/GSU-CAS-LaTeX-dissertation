While I do not own, nor did I create, the vast majority of the LaTeX template 
distributed here, I did make a number of modifications that improve the user's 
ability to:
1. Make and use SI units
2. Compile individual section files for focused work
3. Learn and integrate Git into their writing process
4. Install a 'lean' LaTeX distribution with only the required packages
5. Work specifically in a VS Code environment
6. Use Perl/latexmk utilities for path mgmt and auxiliary file cleaning

My major contributions to the GSU CAS LaTeX template pertain to the *process* 
of writing, not the content itself, and it's the specific configuration I've 
devised that is being shared here.
The reason for this license is to make explicit that I do ***NOT*** want 
default copyright laws to apply to this repository, meaning I want this 
repository to be freely shared, distributed, and improved by the relevant 
community that will use it.

I make no guarantees that this particular version of the template will meet
the CAS guidelines in perpetuity, though as of 2025, this is the provided
template.
